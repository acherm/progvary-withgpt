Here's an example:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#ifdef DOUBLE\ntypedef double myfloat;\n#elif defined(FLOAT)\ntypedef float myfloat;\n#else\ntypedef long double myfloat;\n#endif\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare and initialize variables\n    myfloat x;\n    myfloat y;\n    myfloat z;\n\n#ifdef DOUBLE\n    x = 1.0;\n    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;\n#elif defined(FLOAT)\n    x = 1.0f;\n    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;\n#else\n    x = 1.0L;\n    y = 0x1p-53L + 0x1p-64L;\n#endif\n    z = x + y;\n\n    // Print the value of z\n    printf(\"z = %a\\n\", z);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this variation, we define both the `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. Depending on which macro is defined, the program will use either `double`, `float`, or `long double` for the variables.\n\nWhen `DOUBLE` is defined, the literal constants can be expressed using the default floating-point notation without any suffix. This is because the default floating-point literal in C is a `double`. The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `double`, which is expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation.\n\nWhen `FLOAT` is defined, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `float`, which is expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation.\n\nFinally,"
