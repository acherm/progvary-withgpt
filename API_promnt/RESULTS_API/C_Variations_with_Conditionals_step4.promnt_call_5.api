Here's an example:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#ifdef DOUBLE\ntypedef double myfloat;\n#elif defined(FLOAT)\ntypedef float myfloat;\n#else\ntypedef long double myfloat;\n#endif\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare and initialize variables\n    myfloat x = 1.0;\n    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;\n    myfloat z = x + y;\n\n    // Print the value of z\n    printf(\"z = %a\\n\", z);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this variation, we define both the `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. If `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables, if `FLOAT` is defined, the program will use `float`, otherwise it will use `long double`.\n\nNote that when using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`. Similarly, when using `double`, the literal constants can be expressed using the default floating-point notation without any suffix.\n\nAlso note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of the selected type. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-53` and `0x1p-64` represent the smallest positive values that can be represented by `double` and `float` respectively.\n\nFinally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal floating-point notation."
