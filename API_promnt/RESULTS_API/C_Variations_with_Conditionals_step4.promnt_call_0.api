Here's an example:\n\n```c\n#include <stdio.h>\n\n#ifdef DOUBLE\ntypedef double myfloat;\n#elif defined(FLOAT)\ntypedef float myfloat;\n#else\ntypedef long double myfloat;\n#endif\n\nint main() {\n    // Declare and initialize variables\n    myfloat x, y, z;\n\n#ifdef DOUBLE\n    x = 1.0;\n    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;\n#elif defined(FLOAT)\n    x = 1.0f;\n    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;\n#else\n    x = 1.0L;\n    y = 0x1p-113L + 0x1p-124L;\n#endif\n\n    z = x + y;\n\n    // Print the value of z\n    printf(\"z = %a\\n\", z);\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\nIn this variation, we define two macros - `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` - and use them to conditionally compile the code. Depending on which macro is defined, the program will use `double`, `float`, or `long double` for the variables.\n\nWhen using `double` or `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` or `d` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.\n\nAlso note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `double` or `float`. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-52` represents the value 2^-52, which is the smallest positive value that can be represented by a `double`. Similarly, `0x1p-23f` represents the same value for `float`.\n\n"
