The float variant is similar to the double variant. The only difference is that the typedef statement defines the type myfloat as float instead of double. Here is the relevant code:

```
#ifdef FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif
```

When the macro FLOAT is defined, the program will use float instead of long double for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use long double.
