To create both double and float variants, you can define two macros named `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x;
    myfloat y;
    myfloat z;

#ifdef DOUBLE
    x = 1.0;
    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
    x = 1.0f;
    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;
#else
    x = 1.0L;
    y = 0x1p-113L + 0x1p-124L;
#endif

    z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define two macros, `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT`, and use them to conditionally compile the code. Depending on which macro is defined, the program will use the corresponding type for the variables. If neither macro is defined, the program will use `long double` by default.

Note that when using `double` or `float`, the literal constants are expressed with the appropriate suffix. This is because the default floating-point literal in C is a `double`.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of the corresponding type. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-52` represents the value 2^-52 for `double`, `0x1p-23f` represents the value 2^-23 for `float` and `0x1p-113L` represents the
