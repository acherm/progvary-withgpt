To have both double and float variants, you can define both `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define both the `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. If `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables, if `FLOAT` is defined, the program will use `float`, otherwise it will use `long double`.

Note that when using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`. Similarly, when using `double`, the literal constants can be expressed using the default floating-point notation without any suffix.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of the selected type. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-53` and `0x1p-64` represent the smallest positive values that can be represented by `double` and `float` respectively.

Finally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal floating-point notation.
