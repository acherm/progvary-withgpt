To have both double and float variants, you can use two preprocessor directives, #ifdef and #else. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define the macros `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. If `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables, if `FLOAT` is defined it will use `float`, otherwise it will use `long double`.

Note that when using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `double` or `float`. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-53` represents the value 2^-53, which is the smallest positive value that can be represented by a `double` or `float`. Similarly, `0x1p-64` represents the next smallest representable value.

Finally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal floating-point notation.
