To create both double and float variants, you can define two macros: `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x;
    myfloat y;
    myfloat z;

#ifdef DOUBLE
    x = 1.0;
    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
    x = 1.0f;
    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;
#else
    x = 1.0L;
    y = 0x1p-53L + 0x1p-64L;
#endif
    z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define two macros: `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. If `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables. If `FLOAT` is defined, the program will use `float` for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use `long double`.

Note that when using `double` or `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` or an `L` to them respectively. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `double` or `float`. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-52` and `0x1p
