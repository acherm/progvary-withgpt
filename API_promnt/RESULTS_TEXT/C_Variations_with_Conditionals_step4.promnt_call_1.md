To have both `double` and `float` variants, you can use the preprocessor directives #ifdef, #else, and #endif to conditionally include or exclude sections of code depending on a defined macro. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x;
    myfloat y;
    myfloat z;

#ifdef DOUBLE
    x = 1.0;
    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;
#elif FLOAT
    x = 1.0f;
    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;
#else
    x = 1.0l;
    y = 0x1p-53l + 0x1p-64l;
#endif

    z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we define three macros: `DOUBLE`, `FLOAT`, and `LONG_DOUBLE`. We then use an #ifdef statement to check if the `DOUBLE` macro is defined, and if so, the program will use `double` for the variables. If `DOUBLE` is not defined, the program will check if the `FLOAT` macro is defined, and if so, it will use `float` for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use `long double` for the variables.

We also use #ifdef statements to set the appropriate literal constants for each type. When using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.

Finally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal
