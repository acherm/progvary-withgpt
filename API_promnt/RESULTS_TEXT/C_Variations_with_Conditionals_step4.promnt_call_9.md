To create both double and float variants of the program, you can define both the `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x;
    myfloat y;
    myfloat z;

#ifdef DOUBLE
    x = 1.0;
    y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;
#elif defined(FLOAT)
    x = 1.0f;
    y = 0x1p-23f + 0x1p-34f;
#else
    x = 1.0L;
    y = 0x1p-53L + 0x1p-64L;
#endif
    z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define both the `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` macros and use them to conditionally compile the code. Depending on which macro is defined, the program will use either `double`, `float`, or `long double` for the variables.

When `DOUBLE` is defined, the literal constants can be expressed using the default floating-point notation without any suffix. This is because the default floating-point literal in C is a `double`. The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `double`, which is expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation.

When `FLOAT` is defined, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. The values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of `float`, which is expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation.
