To create a variation with both `double` and `float` variants, you can define two macros named `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. Here's an example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif defined FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-52 + 0x1p-63;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}
```

In this variation, we define the macros `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT` and use them to conditionally compile the code. If `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables. If `FLOAT` is defined, the program will use `float`. Otherwise, the program will use `long double`.

Note that when using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of the type used. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation. In this case, `0x1p-52` or `0x1p-23f` represent the smallest positive value that can be represented by a `double` or `float`, respectively. Similarly, `0x1p-63` or `0x1p-34f` represent the next smallest representable value.

Finally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal floating-point notation.
