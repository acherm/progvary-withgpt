To create these two variations, you could use the following code:
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef VARIATION_1
    #define TYPE double
#elif VARIATION_2
    #define TYPE float
#else
    #define TYPE long double
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    TYPE x = 1.0;
    TYPE y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    TYPE z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
}

To compile the first variation, you would need to use the following command:
gcc -DVARIATION_1 program.c

To compile the second variation, you would need to use the following command:
gcc -DVARIATION_2 program.c
