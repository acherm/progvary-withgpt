To create both double and float variants of the program, you can use the preprocessor directives #ifdef, #else, and #endif to conditionally include or exclude sections of code depending on a defined macro. Here's an example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#elif FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} 
```

In this program, we define two macros: `DOUBLE` and `FLOAT`. We then use the `#ifdef`, `#elif`, and `#endif` preprocessor directives to conditionally compile the code.

If the macro `DOUBLE` is defined, the program will use `double` for the variables. If the macro `FLOAT` is defined, the program will use `float` for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use `long double`.

Note that when using `float`, you need to specify the type of the literal constants by appending an `f` to them. This is because by default, floating-point literals in C are interpreted as `double`.

Also note that the values of `x` and `y` are adjusted to use the appropriate precision of the selected type. The values are expressed in hexadecimal using the `p` notation, which represents the number in binary scientific notation.

Finally, we print the value of `z` using the `%a` format specifier to display the value in hexadecimal floating-point notation.
