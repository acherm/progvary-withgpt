I have the following program 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    long double x = 1.0;
    long double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    long double z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} 
and I'd like to create variations over this program using conditional compilation... Specifically, I'd like to create a first variation that consists in replacing the type long double by double... and another alternative variation that consists in replacing long double by float
