We asked this:
I have the following program #include <stdio.h>



int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    long double x = 1.0;
    long double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    long double z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} and I'd like to create variations over this program using conditional compilation and #ifdef cpp directives... specifically, I'd like to create a first variation that consists in replacing the type long double by double... and another alternative variation that consists in replacing long double by float

You answer this:
You can use the preprocessor directives `#ifdef`, `#elif`, and `#endif` to create conditional compilation. Here's an example that shows how to create the variations you mentioned:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Define the type to use as an alias
#ifdef USE_DOUBLE
    typedef double real;
#elif defined(USE_FLOAT)
    typedef float real;
#else
    typedef long double real;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    real x = 1.0;
    real y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    real z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    #ifdef USE_DOUBLE
        printf("z (using double) = %a\n", z);
    #elif defined(USE_FLOAT)
        printf("z (using float) = %a\n", z);
    #else
        printf("z (using long double) = %La\n", z);
    #endif

    return 0;
}
```

To compile and run the different variations, you can use the following commands:

1. For the original version using `long double`:

```
gcc -o original main.c
./original
```

2. For the variation using `double`:

```
gcc -DUSE_DOUBLE -o double_variation main.c
./double_variation
```

3. For the variation using `float`:

```
gcc -DUSE_FLOAT -o float_variation main.c
./float_variation
```

These commands will compile and run the different variations of the program according to the defined type.


Now,
write a Python script that compiles/executes the three variants above, with and without the -mfpmath=387 of gcc... Compile also with clang. Synthesize all results in a CSV containing the configuration (flag, with or without -mfpmath=387, compiler) and the different outputs
