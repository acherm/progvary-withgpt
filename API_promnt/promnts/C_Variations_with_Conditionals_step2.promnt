I have the following program 
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    long double x = 1.0;
    long double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    long double z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} 
and I'd like to create variations over this program using conditional compilation... Specifically, I'd like to create a first variation that consists in replacing the type long double by double... and another alternative variation that consists in replacing long double by float

You answered:
To create variations over this program using conditional compilation, you can use preprocessor directives in C such as #ifdef, #else, and #endif to conditionally include or exclude sections of code depending on a defined macro.

For example, to create a variation with double, you can use the macro #define DOUBLE and then use #ifdef and #endif directives to conditionally include the relevant code. Here's an example:

```
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef DOUBLE
typedef double myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} 
```

When the macro DOUBLE is defined, the typedef statement will define the type myfloat as double, and the program will use double instead of long double for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use long double.

To create a variation with float, you can use a similar approach:

```
#include <stdio.h>

#ifdef FLOAT
typedef float myfloat;
#else
typedef long double myfloat;
#endif

int main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    myfloat x = 1.0;
    myfloat y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;
    myfloat z = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    printf("z = %a\n", z);

    return 0;
} 
```

When the macro FLOAT is defined, the program will use float instead of long double for the variables. Otherwise, the program will use long double.

Now I ask:
what about the float variant?
