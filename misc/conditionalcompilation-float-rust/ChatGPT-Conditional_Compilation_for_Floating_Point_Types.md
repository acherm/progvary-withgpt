# Conditional Compilation for Floating Point Types

#### You:
fn main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    let x: f64 = 1.0;
    let y: f64 = 1.0;
    let z: f64 = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    println!("z = {:x?}", z);
} 
 I'd like to create variation over this program using conditional compilation. Specifically, I'd like to create a variation that consists in replacing the type f64 by f32... 

#### ChatGPT:
You can use conditional compilation in Rust to create variations of your code that depend on certain compile-time flags or conditions. In your case, you can use the `cfg` attribute to conditionally compile the code based on a flag that specifies whether to use `f32` or `f64`:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "use_f32")]
type Float = f32;

#[cfg(not(feature = "use_f32"))]
type Float = f64;

fn main() {
    // Declare and initialize variables
    let x: Float = 1.0;
    let y: Float = 1.0;
    let z: Float = x + y;

    // Print the value of z
    println!("z = {:x?}", z);
}
```

In this code, we define a conditional compilation flag called `use_f32`. When this flag is set, the `Float` type will be defined as `f32`. Otherwise, it will be defined as `f64`.

To compile the code with `f32` instead of `f64`, you can use the `--features` flag:

```
cargo run --features use_f32
```

This will enable the `use_f32` feature, causing the code to use `f32` instead of `f64`. If you omit the `--features` flag, the code will use `f64` by default.
