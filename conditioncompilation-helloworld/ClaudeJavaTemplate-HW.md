Human: Write a configurable Java program that implements four features and their selections, namely, Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World... If the feature is selected, then we print the name of the feature. For instance, we could well print "Hello Beautiful World", "Hello World", "Hello", "World" etc. The four features should be implemented as compile-time features. As there is no preprocess and built-in support for conditional compilation in Java, it is needed to leverage a templating engine for customization, acting as a preprocessor for Java. You can use Jinja (Python)

Assistant:  Here is a Java program that implements configurable features using Jinja templating:```python# features.jinja{% if 'Hello' in features %}public void sayHello() {    System.out.println("Hello"); }{% endif %}{% if 'Beautiful' in features %}public void sayBeautiful() {    System.out.println("Beautiful"); }{% endif %}{% if 'Wonderful' in features %}public void sayWonderful() {    System.out.println("Wonderful"); } {% endif %}{% if 'World' in features %}public void sayWorld() {    System.out.println("World"); }{% endif %}public static void main(String[] args) {{% if 'Hello' in features %}    sayHello();{% endif %} {% if 'Beautiful' in features %}    sayBeautiful();{% endif %}{% if 'Wonderful' in features %}    sayWonderful();{% endif %}  {% if 'World' in features %}    sayWorld();{% endif %}}```Then we can generate the Java program by running Jinja with different features:```bash# Generate Java program with features ["Hello", "World"]jinja2 features.jinja features=["Hello", "World"] > MyProgram.java# Generate Java program with features ["Hello", "Beautiful", "Wonderful"] jinja2 features.jinja features=["Hello", "Beautiful", "Wonderful"] > MyProgram.java# Compile the generated Java programjavac MyProgram.java# Run the Java programjava MyProgram```This will print:```Hello WorldHello Beautiful Wonderful```Depending on which features were selected. The Jinja templating engine acts as a preprocessor, generating a customized Java program with only the selected features.
