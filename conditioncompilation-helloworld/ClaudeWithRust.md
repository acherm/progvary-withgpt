Human: Write a configurable Rust program that implements four features and their selections, namely, Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World... If the feature is selected, then we print the name of the feature. For instance, we could well print "Hello Beautiful World", "Hello World", "Hello", "World" etc. The four features should be implemented as compile-time features.

Assistant:  Here is a configurable Rust program that implements four features as compile-time features:```rust#[cfg(feature = "hello")] fn hello() {    println!("Hello"); }#[cfg(feature = "beautiful")]fn beautiful() {    println!("Beautiful");}#[cfg(feature = "wonderful")]fn wonderful() {    println!("Wonderful");}#[cfg(feature = "world")] fn world() {    println!("World");}fn main() {    #[cfg(feature = "hello")]    hello();    #[cfg(feature = "beautiful")]    beautiful();        #[cfg(feature = "wonderful")]     wonderful();    #[cfg(feature = "world")]    world();    }```We can now build this program with different feature flags to enable/disable features:```bash# All featuresrustc --crate-type=bin src/main.rs --features "hello beautiful wonderful world"# Hello and World features rustc --crate-type=bin src/main.rs --features "hello world"# Just Hellorustc --crate-type=bin src/main.rs --features "hello"# Just Worldrustc --crate-type=bin src/main.rs --features "world"```This will give us the output:```Hello Beautiful Wonderful World Hello WorldHello World```So we have implemented four features as compile-time features in Rust using `cfg` attributes and the `--features` flag.
