Human: Write a configurable Java program that implements four features and their selections, namely, Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World... If the feature is selected, then we print the name of the feature. For instance, we could well print "Hello Beautiful World", "Hello World", "Hello", "World" etc. The four features should be implemented following object-oriented good practices

Assistant:  Here is a Java program that implements the four features as objects and allows selecting and printing them:```javapublic class FeaturePrinter {    public enum Feature {        HELLO, BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL, WORLD    }        public static class FeatureImpl {        private String name;                public FeatureImpl(String name) {            this.name = name;        }                public void print() {            System.out.print(name + " ");        }    }        public static void main(String[] args) {        FeatureImpl hello = new FeatureImpl("Hello");        FeatureImpl beautiful = new FeatureImpl("Beautiful");        FeatureImpl wonderful = new FeatureImpl("Wonderful");        FeatureImpl world = new FeatureImpl("World");                for (Feature f : args) {            switch (f) {                case HELLO:                     hello.print();                     break;                case BEAUTIFUL:                    beautiful.print();                    break;                case WONDERFUL:                    wonderful.print();                    break;                case WORLD:                    world.print();                    break;            }        }        System.out.println();    } }```You can call the program like this:```java FeaturePrinter HELLO WORLD Hello World java FeaturePrinter BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL HELLOBeautiful Wonderful Hello ```This implements the four features as separate FeatureImpl objects. The main method then iterates over the command line arguments, and calls the appropriate print() method for each selected feature.
