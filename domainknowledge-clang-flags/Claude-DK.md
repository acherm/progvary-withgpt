Human: is there an equivalent of -mfpmath=387 (from gcc) for clang?

Assistant:  Yes, in Clang there are a few options to control floating point math:- -ffast-math: Enable fast-math optimizations that may violate IEEE or ISO rules. This is similar to -mfpmath=387 in GCC.- -fno-fast-math: Disable fast-math optimizations. This is the default.- -ffinite-math-only: Allow optimizations for floating-point arithmetic that assume that arguments and results are not NaNs or +-Infs.- -fno-finite-math-only: Disable optimizations that assume floating-point values are not NaNs or +-Infs. This is the default.- -frounding-math: Enable IEEE-754 conformant rounding optimizations. This is default. - -fno-rounding-math: Disable IEEE-754 conformant rounding optimizations. Useful for debugging numerical code.So the closest equivalent to -mfpmath=387 in Clang would be -ffast-math. This enables more aggressive optimizations that may violate strict IEEE 754 rules, similar to -mfpmath=387.The default in Clang is -fno-fast-math -frounding-math which adheres closely to IEEE 754 rules.Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
