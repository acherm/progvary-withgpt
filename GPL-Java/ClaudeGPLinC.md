Human: I'd like to implement a configurable graph application.The features belong to the graph domain and are named as follows: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted, DFS, BFS, Number, Connected, StronglyConnected, Cycle, MSTPrim, MSTKruskal, Shortest.A graph is either Directed or Undirected. Edges can be Weighted with non-negative numbers or Unweighted. Every graph application requires at most one search algorithm: breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS); and one or more of the following algorithms:*   Vertex Numbering (aka Number feature): Assigns a unique number to each vertex as a    result of a graph traversal.*   Connected Components (aka Connected feature): Computes the connected components    of an undirected graph, which are equivalence classes under the reachable-fromrelation. For every pair of vertices x and y in an equivalence class, there is a pathfrom x to y.*   Strongly Connected Components (aka StronglyConnected feature): Computes the    strongly connected components of a directed graph, which are equivalence classesunder the reachable-from relation. A vertex y is reachable form vertex x if there isa path from x to y.*   Cycle Checking (aka Cycle feature): Determines if there are cycles in a graph. A cycle in    directed graphs must have at least 2 edges, while in undirected graphs it must haveat least 3 edges.*   Minimum Spanning Tree (aka MSTPrim or MSTKruskal features): Computes a Minimum    Spanning Tree (MST), which contains all the vertices in the graph such that thesum of the weights of the edges in the tree is minimal. We include both algorithmsbecause they present distinct and interesting performance and design issues.*   Single-Source Shortest Path (aka Shortest feature): Computes the shortest path from a    source vertex to all other vertices.Please implement such a configurable application in C and conditional compilation

Assistant:  Here is a possible implementation in C using conditional compilation:```c#include <stdbool.h>// Configuration#define DIRECTED #define WEIGHTED// #define DFS #define BFS// #define NUMBER // #define CONNECTED// #define STRONGLY_CONNECTED// #define CYCLE// #define MST_PRIM// #define MST_KRUSKAL // #define SHORTESTtypedef struct Graph {    // Graph representation here} Graph;// Graph functions hereint main() {    Graph g;    // Build graph g...#ifdef DIRECTED    // Graph is directed#else    // Graph is undirected#endif#ifdef WEIGHTED    // Graph is weighted#else    // Graph is unweighted#endif#ifdef DFS    // Perform DFS on graph g#elif BFS    // Perform BFS on graph g #endif#ifdef NUMBER     // Number vertices #endif#ifdef CONNECTED    // Find connected components#endif  #ifdef STRONGLY_CONNECTED    // Find strongly connected components#endif   #ifdef CYCLE    // Check for cycles#endif  #ifdef MST_PRIM    // Compute MST using Prim's algorithm#elif MST_KRUSKAL    // Compute MST using Kruskal's algorithm#endif   #ifdef SHORTEST     // Compute single-source shortest paths#endif}```This allows us to configure the graph application at compile-time by including/excluding the configuration macros. Let me know if you have any other questions!

Human: could you expand a bit your code? in particular Graph

Assistant:  Here is an expanded implementation with more details:```c#include <stdbool.h>// Configuration  ...typedef struct Edge {    int source;    int destination;    int weight;  // Only used if WEIGHTED is defined } Edge;typedef struct Graph {    int num_vertices;    int num_edges;    Edge *edges;  // Array of edges} Graph;// Create an empty graph with n vertices Graph create_graph(int n) {    Graph g;    g.num_vertices = n;    g.num_edges = 0;    g.edges = malloc(0 * sizeof(Edge));    return g;}// Add an edge to the graph void add_edge(Graph *g, int source, int dest, int weight) {    Edge e;    e.source = source;    e.destination = dest;#ifdef WEIGHTED    e.weight = weight; #endif    g->edges = realloc(g->edges, (g->num_edges + 1) * sizeof(Edge));    g->edges[g->num_edges++] = e;}// Graph functions here // DFS, BFS, MST, shortest paths, etc.int main() {    // Build graph g...    Graph g = create_graph(5);    add_edge(&g, 0, 1, 10);     add_edge(&g, 0, 2, 20);    // ...        // Use graph algorithms... #ifdef DFS    // Perform DFS on graph g ...#endif// ...  }```This implementation creates an `Edge` struct to represent edges, and a `Graph` struct to represent the graph, with an array of edges. The `create_graph()` and `add_edge()` functions are used to build the graph, and then graph algorithms can be applied based on the configuration.Let me know if you have any other questions!
