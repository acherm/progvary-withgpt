Human: I have the following program#include <stdio.h>int main() { // Declare and initialize variables long double x = 1.0; long double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64; long double z = x + y;// Print the value of zprintf("z = %a\\n", z);return 0;}and I'd like to create variations over this program using conditional compilation... Specifically, I'd like to create a first variation that consists in replacing the type long double by double... and another alternative variation that consists in replacing long double by float

Assistant: You can use #ifdef to conditionally compile code based on defined symbols:#include <stdio.h> #define USE_DOUBLE #define USE_FLOAT int main() { #ifdef USE_DOUBLE     double x = 1.0;     double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;     double z = x + y; #elif defined(USE_FLOAT)     float x = 1.0f;     float y = 0x1p-53f + 0x1p-64f;     float z = x + y; #else     long double x = 1.0;     long double y = 0x1p-53 + 0x1p-64;     long double z = x + y; #endif // Print the value of z printf("z = %a\n", z); return 0; }Now you can compile this with:gcc -DUSE_DOUBLE ...  // To use double gcc -DUSE_FLOAT ...   // To use float gcc ...                // To use long doubleThis will include either the DOUBLE, FLOAT or default code path.Note that I left USE_DOUBLE and USE_FLOAT defined - only one of those will actually be used. You can #undef them if you don't want them defined in the other cases.
