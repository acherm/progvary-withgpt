# CLI Julia feature selector.

#### You:
Write a configurable Julia program that implements four features and their selections, namely, Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World... If the feature is selected, then we print the name of the feature. For instance, we could well print "Hello Beautiful World", "Hello World", "Hello", "World" etc. Please implement the four features as command-line parameters and the Julia program as a CLI

#### ChatGPT:
You can create a configurable Julia program to implement the four features as command-line parameters using the `ARGS` array to access the command-line arguments. The following code demonstrates this:

```julia
#!/usr/bin/env julia

# You can run this script using the following command:
# $ ./your_script_name.jl Hello World Beautiful Wonderful

function main()
    valid_features = Set(["Hello", "Beautiful", "Wonderful", "World"])
    selected_features = Set{String}()

    for arg in ARGS
        if arg in valid_features
            push!(selected_features, arg)
        else
            println("Invalid feature: ", arg)
            println("Valid features are: Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World")
            return
        end
    end

    if isempty(selected_features)
        println("No features selected. Please select at least one feature from: Hello, Beautiful, Wonderful, and World")
        return
    end

    result = join(selected_features, " ")
    println(result)
end

main()
```

To use this script, save it as a file with a `.jl` extension (e.g., `features.jl`). You can then run the script using the Julia command line, passing the desired features as arguments:

```bash
$ julia features.jl Hello World
Hello World
```
